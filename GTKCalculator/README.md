## SimpleCalc

SimpleCalc is a rudimentary calculator that is written in GTK3+. It supports floating point and the main 4 operators
(addition, subtration, multiplication, and division). This program will be updated in the future to support storing 
previous values, exponents, square/cube root, and other operators and features along the way. 

TO INSTALL:
1. Download the simpleCalc*.tar.gz archive and install.sh script into the same directory
2. Open a terminal and install the program with `./install.sh`
3. If you get a permission error on `./install.sh`, then run `chmod 755 install.sh && ./install.sh`
4. You're done! Find the program by searching for it in a finder, or it can be found in the app tray depending on 
    your distribution.
    
TO UNINSTALL:
1. Download uninstall.sh script
2. Run `./uninstall.sh` - if there's a permission error, run `chmod 755 uninstall.sh && ./uninstall.sh`
