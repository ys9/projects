Binary Calculator with addition, subtraction, and, or, and xor capabilities.

Move all files into one directory and use 'make' to compile, then './binary_calculator' to run.

The calculator will ask you for a word size, which is the maximum allowable inputted characters for each 
side of the expression; for example, the highest inputtable number on each side of the operator for a 
word size of 5 would be 11111.

The calculator also asks for signed (negative) or unsigned (positive) values for each operation. 
This operation only affects how the product is interpreted, positive or negative, in decimal. 

Valid operators are + (addition), - (subtraction), | (or), & (and), and ^ (xor).

Please don't copy this code without a shout-out, and definitely don't copy this code for a 
school project, as I'm not responsible for MOSS ruining your day.
